## Rules ##

In this game only one will prevail to the top !!!! (like fornite). To get up there players must
fill up the chess the double amount of the current amount in the chess and which represent the reward.

To be able to steal the chess you have to stand until 8 blocks has been resolved in the blockchain test
rinkeby. 

Once a player has won the reward will be divided into 3 part :
1. 5% for the owner of the contract.
2. 80% for the king.
3. 15% as a seed for the next game.

if a bid is made after 8 blocks has been resolved a new game is launch with the seed and a bid twice
higher from the player the rest of his money will be given back in his balance.

Otherwise the winner will also be able to claim his reward then the contract will have to wait a valiant
warrior to take the chess that contain the seed.
